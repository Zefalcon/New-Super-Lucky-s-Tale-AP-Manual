# New-Super-Lucky-s-Tale-AP-Manual
Manual AP implementation for New Super Lucky's Tale

What counts as a check - All letters (L, U, C, K, and Y) within levels, every Page, every Costume (does not include preorder costumes; can be turned off via option), every Medal, and every boss fight

What items can I receive - Letters, Pages, Costumes, Medals, and World Unlocks

What is my goal - Currently there are three possible goals: Defeat Jinx, All Medals, or All Pages

How do I play - There are two ways to play: a fresh file, or a completed file.  

Playing through the game on a fresh file is mostly vanilla, with exceptions for your received items and world unlocks.  You should not mark off LUCKY pages for a level until you have received all 5 letters for that level.  You should not advance to the boss fight until you have received enough pages to unlock that door (8 from Sky Castle, 10 from Veggie Village and Wrestful Retreat, 6 from Gilly Island, and 4 from Hauntingham), and cannot play levels in the next world until you have received the unlock item.  You should not purchase Costumes until you have received enough items to unlock them (usually all pages from that world).  

With a completed file, you will start with one random world unlocked, and can play levels within that world in any order.  The above logic for LUCKY pages and boss fights still applies, but worlds can be visited as soon as you get the unlock item for them.
