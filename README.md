# New-Super-Lucky-s-Tale-AP-Manual
Manual AP implementation for New Super Lucky's Tale

What counts as a check - All letters (L, U, C, K, and Y) within levels, every Page, every Costume (does not include preorder costumes; can be turned off via option), every Medal, and every boss fight

What items can I receive - Letters, Pages, Costumes, Medals, and World Unlocks

What is my goal - Currently there are two possible goals: Defeat Jinx, or All Medals

How do I play - Playing through the game is mostly vanilla, with exceptions for your received items and world unlocks.  You should not mark off LUCKY pages for a level until you have received all 5 letters for that level.  You should not advance to the boss fight until you have received enough pages to unlock that area (8 from Sky Castle, 10 from Veggie Village and Wrestful Retreat, 6 from Gilly Island, and 4 from Hauntingham) or have the "completed file" option on, AND you get the unlock item.  You should not purchase Costumes until you have received enough items to unlock them (usually all pages from that world).
