# New-Super-Lucky-s-Tale-AP-Manual
Manual AP implementation for New Super Lucky's Tale

What counts as a check - All letters (L, U, C, K, and Y) within levels, every Page, every Costume (does not include preorder costumes), and every Medal
What items can I receive - Letters, Pages, Costumes, and Medals
What is my goal - Currently the only goal is defeating Jinx.  Eventually I would like to add Page Count and Medal Count as goals as well

How do I play - Playing through the game is mostly vanilla, with exceptions for your received items.  You should not mark off LUCKY pages for a level until you have received all 5 letters for that level.  You should not advance to the next area until you have received enough pages to unlock that area (8 from Sky Castle, 10 from Veggie Village and Wrestful Retreat, 6 from Gilly Island, and 4 from Hauntingham).  You should not purchase Costumes until you have received enough items to unlock them (usually all pages from that world).
